# Natural Language Processing (NLP) Text Analyzer

## Overview
This is a basic **Natural Language Processing (NLP) Text Analyzer** built in Python. It provides three main text analysis functionalities:
1. **Word Frequency Analysis**: Shows how often each word appears in the text.
2. **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the text (polarity and subjectivity).
3. **Text Summarization**: Provides a simple summary of the text by extracting key sentences.

## Features
- **Word Frequency Analysis**: Identifies the frequency of each word in the input text.
- **Sentiment Analysis**: Analyzes the sentiment of the text (polarity ranges from -1 to 1, subjectivity from 0 to 1).
- **Text Summarization**: Summarizes the text by extracting key sentences.

## Requirements
You need to have **Python 3.x** installed, along with the following libraries:
- **nltk**
- **textblob**

To install the necessary dependencies, run:
```bash
pip install nltk textblob
